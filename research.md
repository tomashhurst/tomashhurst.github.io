**Overview**: my research involves the development and application of a range of [high-dimensional single-cell cytometry/imaging technologies and assays](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies), as well as [computational analysis approaches](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#computational-analysis-approaches), to map dynamic immune responses over time, space, and disease. Previously with the [King Lab](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/nicholas-king.html) during my PhD, and currently with the [Sydney Cytometry Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/) and the collaborative [Immune Dynamics Team](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#computational-analysis-approaches), my team and I collaboratively apply these approaches to the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as [SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), [Zika virus](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) encephalitis, and [West Nile virus](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) encephalitis. We then explore how these datasets, technologies, and analysis methdologies may contribute to, or benefit from, efforts such as the [Human Cell Atlas (HCA)](http://humancellatlas.org/).

This work is summarised in the following four sections (below):
1. [High-dimensional cytometry and imaging technologies](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies)

## High-dimensional cytometry and imaging technologies ##

![HD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomashhurst/tomashhurst.github.io/master/images/HDtech3.png)

Critical to investigating complex immune responses to disease is the capacity to measure cells at the single-cell level, examining multiple features of the cell simultaneously. To address this, we develop and apply a variety of high-dimensional cytometry technologies and assays. We have developed novel technology platforms, such as our world first [10-laser ‘LSR-X’ platform](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/hdflow) developed with BD, and one of the first published 25 colour flow cytometry assays ([Ashhurst et al. 2017](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpim.37)). We also developed the first assays to be used on [Australia’s first mass cytometer (CyTOF)](https://www.immunology.org.au/files/Newsletter_pdfs/ASI_NL_March_2015.pdf) ([Ashhurst et al. 2019](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-9454-0_12)), as well as Australia’s first Imaging Mass Cytometer (IMC, [SpectreMAP Github](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics/SpectreMAP)). We have recently published a book ([HM McGuire, TM Ashhurst (eds). 2019](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-9454-0)), featuring a collecting of up-to-date and cutting-edge protocols in mass cytometry, which is now a standard resource in the field. Most recently, we have implemented high-dimensional spectral cytometry platforms and panels, and performed comprehensive evaluations of both conventional and spectral cytometry ([Niewold\*, Ashhurst\* et al. 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cyto.a.24211)).

![Comp](https://wiki.centenary.org.au/download/attachments/146080606/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-22%20at%2012.25.13%20pm.png?version=1&modificationDate=1603369521998&api=v2)

Following a seed funding grant from the [Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity](https://www.sydney.edu.au/marie-bashir-institute/) (*"Mapping dynamic immunity: next-generation computational approaches to track the evolution of immune responses in West Nile virus and Zika virus encephalitis"*), we established the ‘[Immune Dynamics](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics)’ team, a collaborative group with a focus on the development of novel computational analysis tools to address challenges in high-dimensional analysis.

My team and I have developed a number of computational analysis approaches, including [SPECTRE](https://wiki.centenary.org.au/display/SPECTRE), an R package that enables comprehensive end-to-end integration and analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data from different batches or experiments ([Ashhurst\*,  Marsh-Wakefield\*, Putri\* et al. bioRxiv. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.22.349563v1.abstract)). To facilitate the analysis of time-series data, we have also developed a number of time-series clustering algorithms, including [ChronoClust](https://github.com/ghar1821/Chronoclust) ([Putri et al. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705119300796)) and [TrackSOM](https://github.com/ghar1821/TrackSOM), which we recently applied to the study of [COVID-19](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) ([Koutsakos et al. 2021](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00019-7)). We have also developed novel multi-perspective methods for the evaluation of clustering algorithms ([Putri et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab038)). Most recently, we have adapted the Spectre package to facilitate spatial analysis of IMC data ([SpectreMAP Github](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics/SpectreMAP)). Our ongoing work is focused on the development of better data integration approaches and spatial analysis tools.

## Application to disease ##

![COVID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomashhurst/tomashhurst.github.io/master/images/COVID%20image%20wide%202.png)

We apply our high-dimensional technologies and analysis approaches to study inflammation and infectious disease. A particular focus has been the study of *immunopathology*, where the immune response to infection may be a significant driver of disease. 

**SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19**

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused >101 million infections and 2.18 million deaths worldwide (as of January 28, 2021). Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in a spectrum of clinical presentations, called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), ranging from asymptomatic to fatal disease. Through a collaboration with the [Doherty Institute](https://www.doherty.edu.au/) and the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/), we comprehensively profiled the immune response to [SARS-CoV-2](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) in a cohort of [COVID-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) patients. Our work demonstrated that patients with severe disease exhibited an excessive and hyper-activated immune response ([Koutsakos et al. 2021](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00019-7)). To study the kinetics of this immune response, we also developed and applied a novel time-series analysis approach called [TrackSOM](https://github.com/ghar1821/TrackSOM).

**Zika and West Nile virus encephalitis and immune modulation**

In mouse models of viral encephalitis, our work has demonstrated that inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages which infiltrate into the brain contribute significantly to disease in [Zika virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/zika-virus) encephalitis ([Hayashida et al. 2019](https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-019-1566-5)) and [West Nile virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus) encephalitis ([Getts et al. 2012](https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-2094-9-246)), and that *immune-modulatory therapies* targeting inflammatory monocytes may inhibit this process ([Getts et al. 2014](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/6/219/219ra7.short)). This work was featured on [ABC News](http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2014/01/16/3926376.htm) and [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/16/heart-attack-damage-can-be-reduced-with-a-simple-injection-say-experts). Our most recent work has demonstrated that viral encephalitis drives an *inflammatory mobilisation of the haematopoietic system* in the bone marrow, resulting in the generation of these pathogenic monocytes ([Ashhurst et al 2019](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-9454-0_12), [Ashhurst 2020, Fluidigm webinar](https://www.fluidigm.com/articles/presentation---mapping-dynamic-immunity-across-time-space-and-disease-state-using-high%E2%80%90dimensional-cytometry-technologies-and-analytics)).

**Immunology**

Through various collaborations, we have applied our approaches in a number of areas, such as IRF8 depletion ([Terry et al. 2015](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/365972)), T cell exhaustion in LCMV infection ([Huber et al. 2017](https://jvi.asm.org/content/91/22/e01219-17.short)), VZV infection of NK cells ([Campbell et al. 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006999)), antibody-mediated cell subset depletion ([Jung et al. 2018](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/201/7/2176.abstract)), interferon-mediated lethality in LCMV infection ([Jung et al. 2020](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008525&rev=1)), B cell responses in multiple sclerosis ([Marsh-Wakefield et al. 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cti2.1133)), and intrapulmonary vaccination strategies ([Ferrell et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41385-021-00379-6)).
