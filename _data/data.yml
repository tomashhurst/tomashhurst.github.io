career-profile:
    title: Overview
    summary: |
      I am a Senior Cytometry Scientist with the <a href="https://sydneycytometry.org.au/">Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility</a>, an Honorary Research Fellow with the <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/schools/sydney-medical-school/discipline-of-infectious-diseases-and-immunology.html">Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation theme</a> and <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/infectious-diseases-institute/">Sydney Infectious Disease Institute</a>, and co-leader of the <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/charles-perkins-centre/our-research/integrative-systems-and-modelling/single-cell-biology.html">Single Cell and Spatial Biology Research Node</a> with the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney. In these roles I specialise in the use of cutting edge high-dimensional cytometry, single-cell, and spatial multiomics technologies for interrogating cellular systems. My work involves the development of new computational and experimental methods to better understand immune development and pathology across the human lifespan, with a particular interest in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory and neuroinvasive infectious diseases. 

      I received my Ph.D in Medicine (Immunology) from the University of Sydney, where I used Australia's first mass cytometry system to discover a role for inflammatory haematopoiesis in the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis. Subsequently I served as a high-dimensional cytometry specialist with the Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility, and held visiting scientist positions with Stanford University and the Francis Crick Institute in London. Across these roles I developed and implemented multiple new techniques for cytometry, single-cell, and spatial analysis, helping to discover key determinants of host protection and pathology in important diseases including COVID-19.
